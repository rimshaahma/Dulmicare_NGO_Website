        The Dulmicare Foundation Story</p>
    <p style="font-weight: 300;">Founded in 2023, Dulmicare Foundation is a not-for-profit organization (NPO) registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP) under Section 42 of the Companies Act 2017, with Incorporation number, 0232649, SECP License No. 1811 and FBR registration No. A514235.  Through education & skills development, poverty alleviation, medical care, environment preservation, and promotion of tolerance, harmony & moral values in the society, we aim to help communities for a better tomorrow. </p>

    <p style="font-weight: 300;"><strong style="font-weight: bolder;" >DULMICARE FOUNDATION </strong>name was chosen keeping in view the affiliation of most of the directors of the company with their native village Dulmial. The Village Dulmial is a historic village in District Chakwal and is known for its contribution in the Armed Forces of Pakistan and British era. In recognition of its services, the village has a unique distinction and honour of having been awarded with a large caliber Artillery Gun which proudly stands at the village entrance. The village Dulmial gets its name from the village founder Mr. Dulmi Khan who was a military commander of Sultan Shahāb-ud-Din Muhammad Ghori. Hence the company name is Dulmicare Foundation. While the Foundation endeavors to bring improvements in village Dulmial and adjoining areas, the territories to which the object of the company extends, have been declared to include whole of Pakistan.

<p style="font-weight: 500;">I started my education from a government school with no chairs or desks. While the school lacked basic infrastructure, I was fortunate to have competent and devoted teachers. Allah swt was  kind and I ended my naval career with three stars on my shoulders. Having  retired from active naval service, I feel incumbent upon myself to give back to society and help under privileged communities for a better tomorrow. I am grateful to my friends and family members who shared my dream and have joined in this journey. May Allah swt help us, make our job easy, guide us to attain our objectives and accept our humble contributions. (Ameen sum Ameen)

His dedication led him to consistently rank first among managers and sales executives across the UK. In 1994, EFU Life Assurance in Pakistan recruited him as an executive based in Lahore. There, he successfully established five new branches from the ground up. In 2000, he returned to the UK due to personal and family commitments. Since retiring, he actively engages in social and charitable endeavors. He served as chairman of the British Pakistan Association in Leicestershire for over five years, guiding its activities with wisdom before transitioning the leadership to a younger successor. He continues to contribute as an advisor. Mr Aslam has been married to Sorriya for 50 years, and with her unwavering support, he has been able to achieve a great deal. They are blessed with four sons, four daughters-in-law whom they consider as their own daughters, and five grandchildren.

Seeking guidance from Allah and the Hadith, he remains committed to serving humanity until his last breath, Insha'Allah.</p>
